   <!-- <p>Here i am farmiliarizing myself with saving my CSS code in a separate
   File and linking it with my HTML document afterwards </p> -->
   
   <!-- <h1 class= "class_A">Good afternoon!</h1>
   
   <P>This code states that anything within the < body > element will be
   written in italics, in green colour and centered on the page. We’ve also
   created our class name (Class_A) and stated that any element connected
   to that class name will have its text written in blue. Let’s say we
   saved the file as Private_code.css.</p>
   
   <h4 class="class_A">Good evening</h4> -->

	 <!--1. Define and learn to use HTML entities (including what entity names and entity numbers are).-->
	<pre>
	 <blockquote cite="https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/html-tutorial/html-entity#:~:text=HTML%20entities%20are%20the%20reserved,mathematical%20operators%2C%20and%20so%20on.">
	     HTML entities are the reserved characters that are used in the HTML document.
	     They are not present in your standard keyboard. They provide a wide range of
		 characters, allowing you to add icons, geometric shapes, mathematical operators,
		 and so on. These are the reserved characters that have special meaning when used
		 in an HTML document. Each of these codes starts with an ampersand and ends with
		 a semicolon.</blockquote>
		 HTML entity numbers begin with &# (ampersand pound) followed by the given number and end with ; (semicolon).
		 While HTML entity names simply start with & (ampersand)followed by the given name and end with ;(semicolon).
		 examples:
		  
          &#8364;  This entity will display €.
         HTML entity number syntax
     
          &euro;   This entity will display € too.
         HTML entity name syntax
         
		 The beginning and end tags are the same when using either entities. Name entity are great because they can
		 be easier to remember than number entity. For example, &amp;(&) stands for “ampersand” and &pound; (£) stands for
		 “pound,” which are a lot easier to remember than &#38; and &#163; respectively.Note, however, that these are 
         very easy examples. 		 
		 </pre>
		 
		</center> 
		 <!--i. Open the Basic_HTML_5.html file and utilize either &entity_name; or &entity_number; to add a character
		 to your code.-->
		 <center><h4><b><i>i.  utilizing either "&entity_name;" or "&entity_number;" to add a character to code.</i></b></h4></center>
		 
	<p>Hey mate, has it ever occured to you that 50 is actually &#60 (< less than)53? ; and that 63 is also &gt
	(> greater than) 60? Check it out man!!!<p><br>
	<br>
	<!-- <p>What to note in the following exercise is that upon using the "non breaking space" character with the name "Harvard 
	School Of Gossip," the name will always remain written together on the same line, no matter the size to which the web page
	rendered is reduced.</p> -->
	
	<p>I will be presenting an interesting study on one of the most popular gossips in "Havard&nbsp;School&nbsp;Of&nbsp;Gossips"
	tomorrow. Don't miss out!>

	<!-- <p>ii. Define and learn to use the CSS text-shadow property</p> -->
	
	<pre>The text-shadow CSS property adds shadows to text. In other words, it is used to display the text with shadow. It accepts
	a comma-separated list of shadows to be applied to the text and any of its decorations . Each shadow is described by some
	combination of X and Y offsets from the element, blur radius,and color
       This property expresses pixel length, breadth, and width of the shadow and the color of the property shadow.</pre>

	<!-- <p>ii. Open the Basic_CSS_2.css file and utilize the text-shadow property to add a shadow behind an element in your
	Basic_HTML_5.html file.</p> -->
