     <h3>Studying....A Way Of Life</h3>
	   
	   <h6>(An Extract From Oreifo's Journal)</h6>
  <main> 
   <p>
     Literally, "Studying" means Studying....otherwise,..what else could it mean??? Well....
	 What i mean is when you say "Studying" you actually mean "Studying", right???......
	 hmmmm ...this is absurd!!!... ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!! Just joking...<br>
	 <!-- <! Learning how to utilize the HTML blockquote element.> -->
	 <!-- <!Note that Blockquotes are used to quote external sources> -->
	 On a more serious note, according to Googleâ€™s English dictionary provided by Oxford Languages,
	 "Studying" is to:
	 <blockquote>
	 "devote time and attention to gaining knowledge of (an academic subject), especially by means of books."
	 </blockquote>
	 
	 <!-- Adding citation in our blockquote -->
	 
	 Another definition of "Studying" is:
	 <blockquote cite="https://www.thefreedictionary.com/studying">
	 "a. The effort to acquire knowledge, as by reading, observation, or research: The study of language
	    has overturned many misconceptions.
     b. An act or effort made in the pursuit of knowledge: applied himself to his studies.
     c. A branch of knowledge or department of learning: the study of geography; graduate studies."
	 </blockquote>
	 The basic point to note here, however, is that "studying" is an activity that usually spans a period of time.
	 In other words,it isn't a life time activity.This is one  basic factor that distinguishes "Studying" from "Learning",which,
	 according to extracts from Wikipedia;
	 <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning">
	 "Learning is the process of acquiring new understanding, knowledge, behaviors, skills, values, attitudes, and
	 preferences...Learning starts at birth (it might even start before, in terms of an embryo's need for both
	 interaction with, and freedom within its environment within the womb) and continues until death as a consequence of ongoing interactions
	 between people and their environment."
	 </blockquote>
	 The end result of "Studying" is "Learning". In other words, Studying  is the art that paves the way to Learning:  meaning
	 in the absence of Studying, Learning is inexistent.<br>

	 Here are some images illustrating "Studying".<br>

	  "Study"(noun) on the other hand, is a vast discussion on its own.Several quotes on this word include:
	  <blockquote>
	  
      <p>"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."</p>
