   <h1>Luxury Cars</h1>
   <h4>An Article For Car Lovers </h4> 
   <p>
      The Car is another of God's wonderful creations whilst utilizing the mind of man and his agility.
	 The concept of the car we so carefreely ride in may not command as much awe, today, as it 
	 did, yesteryears, in the sight of those who saw the first car rolled out of the car producing 
	 factory. In fact, we have so many avenues of enlightenment in this age of ours that the marvel in the
	 production of cars has abated significantely. However, what leaves the jaws agap with awe, these days, is
	 the magnificience and beauty of some brands of cars we see rolling out of some car factories in our part of
	 the world of automobiles.....an epitome of excellence reflecting from their glamour.
      At this juncture, it is worth noting that these cars come at a very expensive rate;... hence they are usually
	 classified, by default (smile),as <b>"Luxury Cars"</b>. A single glance at these cars is enough justification
     for the admiration they command from the beholder and the "Luxury" label alotted them. If my words are not
	 convincing enough then see an <b>image</b> of one of such cars below:<br>
