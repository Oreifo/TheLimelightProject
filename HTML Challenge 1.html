	  See this <b>Embedded</b> Youtube video for a quick recap of what i mean:<br>
	  <br>
	  <!-- Unlike the process of linking videos to Html web pages, eg : -->
	  <!-- <a href="https://youtu.be/0eKVizvYSUQ">Knowledge Made Easy!!!</a>,embedding a video in your web page gives you the 
	  opportunity to add or remove attributes associated with the video's functionalities as noted below: -->
	  
	  <!-- Embedded Video from a root folder: -->
	  <!-- Here we are going to start from the rudimentary point and adding all the necessary attributes to obtain a functional -->
      <!-- video.	   -->
	  <!-- <video src="Videos/Visit To Cambridge University.mp4"></video><br> -->
	  <!-- <br> -->
	  <!-- As can be noted,the size of this video is too large and it is non functional.This requires the addition of some attributes -->
	  <!-- to rectify. -->
	  
	  <!-- b.  <i>Adjust the video size and add controls and some other attributes to make it functional</i><br> -->
	  <!-- <br> -->
	  
	  <!-- <video controls mute loop width="300"> -->
	    <!-- <source src="Videos/Visit To Cambridge University.mp4">  -->
	  <!-- </video><br> -->
	  <!-- <br> -->
	  <!-- C.  <i>We can also add the autoplay attribute if we want the video to start playing automatically,as well as place  -->
	  <!-- the video in center of the web page.</i> -->
	  <!-- <center> -->
	  <!-- <video controls mute autoplay loop width="300"> -->
	     <!-- <source src="Videos/Visit To Cambridge University.mp4"> -->
	  <!-- </Video> -->
	  <!-- </center> -->
	  <!-- This Notepad++ web page does not support video autoplay. -->
	  
	  <h5>Embedded Video from Youtube</h5>
	  
	  
	  <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPn3tVFTgi4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>"<br>
	  <br>
	  As noted above, in the process of embedding videos from root folders in your computer,you can also toggle with the attributes
	  assigned to this video from an external source,(though with some limitations) e.g; you can adjust the size,frameborder,
	  move the video to the center of the web page, etc.
