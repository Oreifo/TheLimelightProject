# TheLimelightProject
This is my very first project as a Software Developer Newbie. The beginning of a journey into limelight in the Developer's Wonderous world!!

 At the outset, this project will showcase rudimentary programming works with the "Building Blocks Of The Web":
HTML
CSS
JS(Javascripts).
As work proceeds on this project, a more advanced approach will be engaged involving the additional use of programming languages and tools as
will be required.

This README.md file will be updated (edited) the various phases(Lifecycle?) of this project work.
