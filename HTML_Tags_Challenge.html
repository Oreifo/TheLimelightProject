			<h1>Riding The Wind</h1>
			<p><small>Author: Oreifo</small></p>
			
				<p>
				'Riding the wind' is a spectacular phenomenon.In a simple term, it is the act of leveraging on the strength <br>
				of the wind to accomplish a determined goal,such as soaring, like the eagle does in the midst of a daring<br>
				tempest.

				<summary>About the Eagle and the Wind</summary>
				Unlike other birds that dart for cover in the midst of a tempest, the eagle delights in its arrival instead.<br>
				To the eagle, it is just another opportunity to relish the joy of being the king of the sky....which is usually <br>
				the dream or, better put, "the limit" of other creatures. Like every endeavour in life, however,"nothing <br>
				worthwhile comes easily." Meaning before the eagle can enjoy the joy in <em><strong>Riding the wind,</strong></em>it has to <br>
				engage the process of vigorously flapping its ususlly heavy wings to propel itself into the depths of the sky,<br>
				breaking through the tempest which, ironically, eventually equips it to glird carefreely as it soars high above the<br>
				sky.

				Being a part of my course work, it is expected of me to submit this assignment by tomorrow, <time datetime="01.11.2023">November 1,</time><br>
				before <time datetime="20:00:00">20:00hrs</time>. This leaves me with just a little above <time datetime="PT10H20M">10hrs 20mins</time><br>
				before deadline.
